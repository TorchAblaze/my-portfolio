        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>Experience:</h3>
        <p>
          I am currently a student at Epicodus where I'm learning how to
          become a super awesome programmer. I attended Norwich University
          and have a bachelor's degree in Psychology. Before applying to
          Epicodus, I was previously a law enforcement officer. I started
          teaching myself to code about a year ago and decided to switch
          careers to learn a new set of skills and help make a positive
          impact through computer programming.
        </p>
        <h3>Interests:</h3>
        <p>
          I really enjoy gaming and watching movies. Right now, the games
          I've been playing the most are Horizon Zero Dawn for the PS4 and
          Astroneer on Steam. I also love traveling/exploring new places,
          hiking, puns (they are intended) and coffee shops. I probably
          won't be doing any of these things nearly as much while I'm
          attending Epicodus, but lucky for me, I really like coding, too!
