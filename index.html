  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <h3>Background:</h3>
  <p>I am currently a student at Epicodus where I'm learning how to become a super awesome programmer.
    I attended Norwich University and have a bachelor's degree in Psychology. I have teaching
    experience and was previously a law enforcement officer. I decided to switch careers to learn a new
    set of skills and help make a positive impact on the world through computer programming.</p>
