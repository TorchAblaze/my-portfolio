  <h2>About Me:</h2>
  <h3>Background:</h3>
  <p>I am currently a student at Epicodus where I'm learning how to become a super awesome programmer.
    I attended Norwich University and have a bachelor's degree in Psychology. I have teaching
    experience and was previously a law enforcement officer. I decided to switch careers to learn a new
    set of skills and help make a positive impact on the world through computer programming.</p>

  <h3>Interests:</h3>
  <p>I really enjoy gaming and watching movies. Right now, the games I've been playing most is Horizon 
    Zero Dawn for the PS4 and Astroneer on Steam. I also love traveling and exploring new places,
    hiking and coffee shops. I probably won't be doing any of these things nearly as much while
    I'm attending Epicodus, but lucky for me, I really like coding, too!</p>
