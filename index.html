    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <h3>Background:</h3>
    <p>I am currently a student at Epicodus where I'm learning how to become a super awesome programmer.
      I attended Norwich University and have a bachelor's degree in Psychology. Before applying to Epicodus, I was previously a law enforcement officer. I started teaching myself to code about a year ago and decided to switch careers to learn a new set of skills and help make a positive impact through computer programming.</p>

    <h3>Interests:</h3>
    <p>I really enjoy gaming and watching movies. Right now, the games I've been playing the most are Horizon Zero Dawn for the PS4 and Astroneer on Steam. I also love traveling/exploring new places, hiking, puns <span class="highlight">(they are intended)</span> and coffee shops. I probably won't be doing any of these things nearly as much while I'm attending Epicodus, but lucky for me, I really like coding, too!</p>
